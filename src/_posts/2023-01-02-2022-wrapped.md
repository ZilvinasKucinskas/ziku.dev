## 2022 Recap

### Career 👨‍💻

It was a big year for my career in 2022! Here are some of the highlights:

* In April, I reduced my freelancing from 5 to 2 days a week and made the switch to full-time indie hacking in September. You can read more about the decision in this [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/zilkucinskas/status/1572617601100181511).
* I grew my business, [ExportData](https://www.exportdata.io/), significantly, with a 90% increase in revenue, 3x growth in traffic, and a jump in domain rating from 21 to 33.
* Every feature I built for ExportData was requested by a customer at some point, which was a great validation of my product development process.
* Had plenty of time to work with Hotwire ⚡️.
* I launched my personal website - [ziku.dev](https://www.ziku.dev/), and hired my first Ruby on Rails intern in December.

### Personal / Fitness 🏃

In 2022, I made some great progress in my personal and fitness goals:

* I managed to stay smoke-free all year, which was a big accomplishment for me. 🚭
* I finished InvisAlign treatment and finally got my perfect smile.
* I spent the year between 12%-17% body fat, with the help of Eric Helms's book, [The Muscle & Strength Pyramid](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28431669-the-muscle-strength-pyramid---nutrition). I also tracked my food intake with MyFitnessPal for about 4 months, which helped me get into the best shape of my life.

## Failures

While there were many successes in 2022, I also had some setbacks:

* I was rejected from the TinySeed Europe program and the AWS Lofts Startup accelerator.
* My investments in cryptocurrency didn't go as planned, and I lost 90%+ of my portfolio. While it was a financial setback, I learned a valuable lesson to focus on areas where I have much more expertise, such as Ruby on Rails, SaaS, SEO, and software engineering.
* I didn't succeed in launching another SaaS product, but I am still in progress on this goal.

## 2023 Goals 🎯

As I look ahead to 2023, I have set some ambitious goals for myself:

### Career 👨‍💻

* Reach $20k MRR across my businesses.
* Build a larger Twitter audience - my goal is to grow my account to 2k followers. I want to try syndicating larger posts to LinkedIn.
* Write quarterly goals and keep myself accountable.
* Launch another SaaS product. Currently in progress. 🚧
* Launch my first info product. (Small bet)
* Incorporate consulting services to my personal website.
* Write 4 tech blog posts.
* Attend [Railsconf](https://railsconf.org/) and/or [The Rails SaaS Conference](https://railssaas.com/).

### Personal / Fitness 🏃

* Follow a schedule of two cycles of 4 months of gaining followed by 1 month of cutting, with the goal of adding 8kg of mass while maintaining less than 15% body fat.
* Improve my exercise routine. I have a set of 12.5kg, 15kg, 17.5kg, and 20kg dumbbells at home, but I may need to incorporate the gym on Saturdays to target certain muscle groups.
* Have my 2nd burn at Burning Man if everything goes according to the plan.
