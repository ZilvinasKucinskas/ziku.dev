You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `bridgetown serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Bridgetown requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.EXT`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `EXT` is the file extension representing the format used in the file (for example, `md` for Markdown). After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Bridgetown also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```js
/**
 * Does a thing
 */
function helloWorld(param1, param2) {
  var something = 0;

  // Do something
  if (2.0 % 2 == something) {
    console.log('Hello, world!');
  } else {
    return null;
  }

  // @TODO comment
}
```

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code


Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

};

console.log(foo(5));
```
